The circumstances in which human observers produce different types of eye, head, and body motions differ across the life span, in part due to changes in locomotor abilities and declines in the frequency of passive locomotion. Scene geometry and body posture and position also contribute to the statistics of optic flow. Previous research has shown that 9.5 month-old infants undergoing passive locomotion -- carried by their parents in a forward facing carrier -- view different patterns and speeds of retinal- and head-centered optic flow (Raudies et al., 2012). Here we assess the patterns and speeds of head-centered optic flow experienced by infants across a wider range of ages, postures, and geometries. The data come from videos recorded from infant and adult observers who wore head-mounted cameras while they performed simple natural activities -- walking, sitting, playing with toys, and interacting with caregivers. We estimated optic flow from short (~30 sec) long segments using the method of Brox et al. (2004). From the flow estimates, we characterized the relative frequency of global rotation (yaw, pitch, and roll) and translation (forward/backward, up/down, and side to side) patterns and overall speeds. We found that infants who are not moving passively view translational flow patterns significantly more often than infant/mother dyads in paired locomotion. Further, infants who are not coupled to an adult in locomotion view a broader, wider, and slower distribution of flow speeds. Thus, the statistics of optic flow differ depending on the type (active vs. passive) self-motion. This implies that the relative frequency of experienced flow patterns and speeds may change substantially across development. Computer vision-based techniques permit a detailed analysis of the statistics of the natural visual environment during development.

Nine-month-old infants were tested at the precipice of safe and risky gaps in the surface of support. Their reaching and avoidance responses were compared in two postures, an experienced sitting posture and a less familiar crawling posture. The babies avoided reaching over risky gaps in the sitting posture but fell into risky gaps while attempting to reach in the crawling posture. This dissociation between developmental changes in posture suggests that (a) each postural milestone represents a different, modularly organized control system and (b) infants' adaptive avoidance responses are based on information about their postural stability relative to the gap size. Moreover, the results belie previous accounts suggesting that avoidance of a disparity in depth of the ground surface depends on general knowledge such as fear of heights, associations between depth information and falling, or knowledge that the body cannot be supported in empty space.

               Infants master crawling and walking in an environment filled with varied and unfamiliar surfaces. At the same time, infants' bodies and skills continually change. The changing demands of everyday locomotion require infants to adapt locomotion to the properties of the terrain and to their own physical abilities. This Monograph examines how infants acquire adaptive locomotion in a novel task--going up and down slopes. Infants were tested longitudinally from their first week of crawling until several weeks after they began walking. Everyday locomotor experience played a central role in adaptive responding. Over weeks of crawling, infants' judgments became increasingly accurate, and exploration became increasingly efficient. There was no transfer over the transition from crawling to walking. Instead, infants learned, all over again, how to cope with slopes from an upright position. Findings indicate that learning generalized from everyday experience traveling over flat surfaces at home but that learning was specific to infants' typical method of locomotion and vantage point. Moreover, learning was not the result of simple associations between a particular locomotor response and a particular slope. Rather, infants learned to gauge their abilities on-line as they encountered each hill at the start of the trial. Change in locomotor responses and exploratory movements revealed a process of differentiation and selection spurred by changes in infants' everyday experience, body dimensions, and locomotor proficiency on flat ground.

                             One of the most powerful sources of information about spatial relationships available to mobile organisms is the pattern of visual motion called optic flow. Despite its importance for spatial perception and for guiding locomotion, very little is known about how the ability to perceive one’s direction of motion, or heading, from optic flow develops early in life. In this article, we report the results of 3 experiments that tested the abilities of 4-month-old infants to discriminate optic flow patterns simulating different directions of self-motion. The combined results from 2 different experimental paradigms suggest that 4-month-olds discriminate optic flow patterns that simulate only large (&gt;32 deg) changes in the direction of the observer’s motion through space. This suggests that prior to the onset of locomotion, there are limitations on infants’ abilities to process patterns of optic flow related to self-motion.

first several years of life. As a result, the statistics of visual motion infant observers experience differ from adults in some situations. We ask whether these differences apply more generally, and if so, what factors account for them. In one analysis, we simulate the effects of changes in body posture, speed of locomotion, and surface geometry on motion statistics. In a second analysis, we empirically measure the statistics of visual motion experienced by observers across the first year of life using infant-perspective videos captured during episodes when infants were moving through space or were stationary. We include samples of infants in from North America and those from India, to assess how variations in cultural practices influence infants' visual experiences. We find that fast laminar motion patterns dominate the visual input young infants experience and that cultural differences play a small role in shaping visual motion experiences.

are possible to achieve a goal. How do people select a particular action among equally possible alternatives? In six experiments, we determined whether action selection is consistent and biased toward one decision by observing participants’ decisions to go over or under a horizontal bar set at varying heights. We assessed the height at which participants transitioned from going over to under the bar within a “gray zone”—the range of bar heights at which going over and under were both possible. In Experiment 1, participants’ transition points were consistently located near the upper boundary of the gray zone, indicating a bias to go over rather than under the bar. Moreover, transitional behaviors were clustered tightly into a small region, indicating that decisions were highly consistent. Subsequent experiments examined potential influences on action selection. In Experiment 2, participants wore ankle weights to increase the cost of going over the bar. In Experiment 3, they were tested on a padded surface that made crawling under the bar more comfortable. In Experiment 4, we introduced a secondary task that required participants to crawl immediately after navigating the bar. None of these manipulations altered participants’ decisions relative to Experiment 1. In Experiment 5, participants started in a crawling position, which led to significantly lower transition points. In Experiment 6, we tested 5- to 6-year-old children as in Experiment 1 to determine the effects of social pressure on action selection. Children displayed lower transition points, larger transition regions, and reduced ability to go over the bar compared to adults. Across experiments, results indicate that adults have a strong and robust bias for upright locomotion.

Illustrates use of toys to lure baby. Experimenters are particularly talented.\n\nCrawling Example 2: Experimenter carrying baby, mom at end of walkway, gridded high-density foam surface. Example of how to run crawling gait when only one experimenter is available.\n\nCrawling Example 3: Experimenter carrying baby, mom and experimenter at end of walkway, gridded high-density foam surface, infant wearing head-mounted eye tracker.\n\nLocomotor histories correspond to pdf's by Subject #. Note how experimenter clearly defines the criteria over and over. She zeroes in on the correct age through a "negotiation" with the parent. If parent gives an age, experimenter returns with a date. If parent offers a date, experimenter returns with an age. Then experimenter tries to get parent to remember specific event when baby was walking/cruising/crawling (a holiday, birthday, special outing).\n\nBlank form for entering parent's report about the baby's locomotion. Date fields on the right provide a "cheat sheet" so that the experimenter can quickly translate dates into ages and ages into dates.\n\nExcerpt of testing sitting proficiency: experimenter tests number of seconds the baby is able to maintain upright posture with hands up in the air while doing a long sit and a short sit. Experimenter also tests sitting balance using the Segmental Assessment of Trunk Control (SATCo).

infants are exposed to, how these change across development, and how they influence the maturation of motion-sensitive brain networks. Here we develop a set of techniques to study the optic flow experienced by infants and mothers during locomotion as a first step toward a broader analysis of the statistics of the natural visual environment during development.

has been studied using two very different paradigms: free viewing of flat screen displays in desk-mounted eye-tracking studies and real-world visual guidance of action in head-mounted eye-tracking studies. To test whether classic findings from screen-based studies generalize to real-world visual exploration and to compare natural visual exploration in infants and adults, we tested observers in a new paradigm that combines critical aspects of both previous techniques: free viewing during real-world visual exploration. Mothers and their 9-month-old infants wore head-mounted eye trackers while mothers carried their infants in a forward-facing infant carrier through a series of indoor hallways. Demands for visual guidance of action were minimal in mothers and absent for infants, so both engaged in free viewing while moving through the environment. Similar to screen-based studies, during free viewing in the real world low-level saliency was related to gaze direction. In contrast to screen-based studies, only infants - not adults - were biased to look at people, participants of both ages did not show a classic center bias, and mothers and infants did not display high levels of inter-observer consistency. Results indicate that several aspects of visual exploration of a flat screen display do not generalize to visual exploration in the real world.

caregivers is a mainstay of developmental research. However, common paradigms for studying infant-caregiver interaction oversimplify the act of social looking by placing infants and caregivers in stationary positions facing each other. In more naturalistic settings, infants and caregivers must coordinate movements of their bodies and heads to look at each another amid the demands of other ongoing actions. We hypothesized that social looking for each member of the dyad would be affected by 1) the motor costs of looking and 2) competition between the social partner’s face and other visual targets. To test these hypotheses, twelve-month-old infants and their parents wore head-mounted eye trackers to provide a moment-by-moment measure of whether each member of the dyad looked at the other’s face or looked at toys. Findings revealed that motor costs did affect looking: Social looking varied according to the body posture of infants and caregivers. Transitions between postures changed the likelihood of face looking by altering the observer’s viewpoint and the availability of the social partner’s face. Moreover, the presence of other visual targets greatly impacted infants’ but not caregivers’ social looking: Infants rarely looked at their parents’ faces but often looked at toys. In contrast, parents frequently looked at both infants’ faces and toys.

Recent research suggests that locomotor exploration is not primarily directed toward reaching distant people, places or things. We asked whether a room with toys designed to encourage movement (stroller, ball, etc.) elicits more locomotor exploration than a room with no toys. Surprisingly, 15-month-old infants produced the same quantity of locomotion in both rooms—even though most walking bouts involved toys when available. Our findings suggest that mere space to move is sufficient to elicit locomotion. However, the quality of locomotor exploration differed. Infants in the toy condition explored a larger percent of the room, and spent a smaller percent of the session within 100 cm of their caregiver. Thus, while not required to elicit locomotion, the presence of alluring destinations seem to encourage infants to travel to new and unexplored areas.

                                     "Cruising" infants can only walk using external support to augment their balance. We examined cruisers' understanding of support for upright locomotion under four conditions: cruising over a wooden handrail at chest height, a large gap in the handrail, a wobbly unstable handrail, and an ill positioned low handrail. Infants distinguished among the support properties of the handrails with differential attempts to cruise and handrail-specific forms of haptic exploration and gait modifications. They consistently attempted the wood handrail, rarely attempted the gap, and occasionally attempted the low and wobbly handrails. On the wood and gap handrails, attempt rates matched the probability of cruising successfully; but on the low and wobbly handrails, attempt rates under- and over-estimated the probability of success, respectively. Haptic exploration was most frequent and varied on the wobbly handrail, and gait modifications-including previously undocumented "knee cruising"-were most frequent and effective on the low handrail. Results are discussed in terms of developmental changes in the meaning of support.

 Flexibility and generativity are fundamental aspects of functional behavior that begin in infancy and improve with experience. How do infants learn to tailor their real-time solutions to variations in local conditions? On a nativist view, the developmental process begins with innate prescribed solutions and experience elaborates on those solutions to suit variations in the body and the environment.On an emergentist view, infants begin by generating a variety of strategies indiscriminately and experience teaches them to select solutions tailored to the current relations between their body and the environment. To disentangle these accounts, we observed coordination patterns in 11-month-old pre-walking infants with a range of cruising (moving sideways in an upright posture while holding onto a support) and crawling experience as they cruised over variable distances between two handrails they held for support. We identified infants’ coordination patterns using a novel combination of computer-vision, machine-learning, and time-series analyses. As predicted by the emergentist view, the least experienced infants generated multiple coordination patterns inconsistently regardless of body size and handrail distance, whereas the most experienced infants tailored their coordination patterns to body-environment relations and switched solutions only when necessary. Moreover, the beneficial effects of experience were specific to cruising and not crawling, although both skills involve anti-phase coordination among the four limbs. Thus, findings support an emergentist view and suggest that everyday experience with the target skill may promote “learning to learn,” where infants learn to assemble the appropriate solution for new problems on the fly.

such as the transition to self-locomotion, have cascading implications for infants’ social and cognitive development. The current studies aimed to add to this literature by exploring whether and how crawling experience impacts a key social-cognitive milestone achieved in infancy: the development of intentional action understanding. Study 1 used a cross-sectional, age-held-constant design to examine whether locomotor (n = 36) and prelocomotor (n = 36) infants differ in their ability to process a failed intentional reaching action. Study 2 (n = 124) further probed this question by assessing how variability in locomotor infants’ experience maps onto variability in their failed intentional action understanding. Both studies also assessed infants’ tendency to engage in triadic interactions to shed light on whether self-locomotion impacts intentional action understanding directly or indirectly via changes in infants’ interactions with social partners. Altogether, results showed no evidence for the role of self-locomotion in the development of intentional action understanding. Locomotor and prelocomotor infants did not differ in their failed action understanding or levels of triadic engagement (Study 1) and individual differences in days of crawling experience, propensity to crawl during play, and maximum crawling speed failed to predict infants’ intentional action understanding or triadic engagement (Study 2). Explanations for these null findings and alternative influences on the development of intentional action understanding are considered.\n\nThis volume includes video examples of the procedures used in Brandone, Stout, &amp; Moty (in press).

gains in infants’ other abilities—better ways to move, see the world, and engage in social interactions (e.g., Adolph &amp; Tamis-LeMonda, 2014). Do the gains associated with walking extend to the communicative behaviors of caregivers? Thirty infant-caregiver dyads were observed during everyday activities at home during the two-month window surrounding the onset of walking (M = 11.98 months, range = 8.74-14.86). A consistent pattern of results emerged: as compared to crawling, bouts of infant walking were more likely to co-occur with caregiver language and gestures that either encouraged locomotion or described objects. Findings suggest that the emergence of walking sets in motion a developmental cascade that shapes the communication caregivers provide.

researchers typically focus on only one domain of expertise. However, children’s development typically does not adhere to researchers’ siloed expertise. Instead, multiple psychological domains develop simultaneously and changes in one domain can cascade into developmental changes in domains far afield from the original accomplishment. This experiment focuses on the developmental relations between walking and talking. \nLearning to walk allows infants to explore the environment in new ways. Compared with crawling, walking infants go more places, see more of the surrounds, and access more distal toys for play. We test whether the changes instigated by walking have a cascading effect on infants’ language experiences. The central hypothesis is that walking prompts a developmental cascade, wherein: (1) walkers explore a wider variety of places and objects than crawlers; (2) enhanced exploration elicits different forms of language input from caregivers; and (3) differences in language input are related to infants’ receptive and productive vocabularies. \nInfants—half crawlers, half walkers—and their caregivers play together with toys in two conditions: (1) toys dispersed throughout a large playroom (high incentive to locomote); and (2) toys clustered in a pile (high incentive to remain stationary). We predict a walking status × condition interaction: Walkers will locomote more and access more toys than crawlers in the dispersed condition; in turn, caregivers will spontaneously respond with more diverse language input to walkers. However, when toys are clustered, crawlers and walkers will produce similarly low amounts of locomotion and similarly frequent interactions with toys, and caregivers will respond with similar language inputs to infants.

expressions and vocalizations that researchers have referred to as a social “dance.” Does this dance continue when both partners are free to move across the floor? Locomotor synchrony was assessed in 13- to 19-month-old infant-mother dyads (N = 30) by tracking each partner’s step-to-step location during free play. Although infants moved more than mothers, dyads spontaneously synchronized their locomotor activity. For 27 dyads, the spatiotemporal path of one partner uniquely identified the path of the other. Clustering analyses revealed two patterns of synchrony (yo-yo, mother-follow), and infants were more likely than mothers to lead the dance. Like face-to-face synchrony, locomotor synchrony scaffolds infants’ interactions with the outside world.
#&gt; 21 Video excerpts for article entitled "Oh, Behave!" in the journal Infancy based on Karen Adolph's Presidential Address to the International Congress on Infant Studies in New Orleans, May 22, 2016. Excerpts illustrate the power of video to capture the richness of behavior and the subtle details of the surrounding context. Many of the excerpts are derived from other volumes stored on Databrary.\n\nVideo 1. Karen Adolph’s Presidential Address, “Oh Behave,” to the International Congress on Infant Studies in New Orleans, May 22, 2016. Video is publicly available and was derived from the Databrary volume with the invited program from the meeting at https://nyu.databrary.org/volume/239.\n\nVideo 2. A baby’s first walking steps and improvements over the next 100 days of walking. Videos were recorded by the infant’s parents during natural activity. (Walk Day 1): First steps, fall. (Walk Day 15): Continuous steps, fall. (Walk Day 17): Walking, falling, crawling. (Walk Day 19): Walking, falling, knee walking. (Walk Day 23): Walks room to room. (Walk Day 26): Walking, falling. (Walk Day 31): Squat to stand. (Walk Day 32): Spinning, falling. (Walk Day 33): Walk to dog and dad. (Walk Day 45): Walking and carrying. (Walk Day 47): Walking outside over varying terrain. (Walk Day 92): Running. (Walk Day 100): Running and carrying. Video is publicly available.\n\nVideo 3. Video captures elements of the behavior and surrounding context that are missing from processed data. Trace from infant walking over instrumented floor and simultaneous video. See Figure 1. Video is publicly available and was derived from the Databrary volume databrary.org/volume/89.\n\nVideo 4. Real-time trace from remote eye tracker and accompanying video. Eye-tracking shows processed data representing infant’s shifts in gaze on the display. Video shows the physical and social context in which the behavior occurred. Video is publicly available and was derived from the Databrary volume databrary.org/volume/192.\n\nVideo 5. Multiple camera views of the same infant and caregiver behaviors. Fish-eye camera view (top left) shows the entire scene. Hand held, third-person camera view (top right) shows the events from an outsider’s perspective. First-person camera views show the events from the infant’s perspective (bottom left) and caregiver's perspective (bottom right). Video is publicly available and was derived from Databrary volume databrary.org/volume/135 at databrary.org/volume/135/slot/8351/-?asset=19611.\n\nVideo 6.

Video is publicly available and was derived from the Databrary volume databrary.org/volume/112.\n\nVideo 7. Exemplar Datavyu spreadsheet of an infant and caregiver in 70s of natural activity in the home. Each column shows a behavior for the infant and the mother—the baby’s vocalizations and mother’s speech, functional language codes, emotion, object interactions, locomotion, and manual gestures. Each cell denotes the onset and offset of one behavior and cells are time-locked to the video. White cells denote events that have not yet happened, green cells are events currently happening on the video, red cells are events that have already happened. Spreadsheet shows temporal alignment among behaviors. Video is publicly available and was derived from the Databrary volume databrary.org/volume/872.\n\nVideo 8.

Science). The head-mounted cameras recorded infants' eye position and field of view. A wheeled camera alongside the platform recorded infants' locomotion from a side view. Caregivers stood at the far end of the walkway and held toys at low, medium, and high elevations to provide targets for infants' gaze. An additional group of 13-month-olds crawled or walked over a gridded platform wearing an electromagnetic motion tracker (Ascension TrakSTAR) to record position and orientation of their heads. In every study, parents provided retrospective reports of infants' locomotor experience and an experimenter measured infants' body dimensions. Additional pilot data include changes in procedure. Videos from a subset of infants were excluded for various reasons.

and 11-month-old crawlers decided whether to cross wide and narrow bridges (2-60 cm) spanning a large (71-cm) or small (17-cm) drop-off to reach their caregivers who encouraged them from the far side of the bridge. An additional group of 14-month-olds walked over a "visual bridge" apparatus, designed to match an apparatus with a real bridge and drop-off. Here, the drop-off and bridge were only illusory. Bridge widths were presented with a psychophysical staircase procedure and each infant received ~40 trials. In each study, an experimenter rescued infants if they fell. In every study, infants' behavior was recorded from side, front, and overhead views, parents provided retrospective reports of infants' crawling, walking, and falling experience, and an experimenter measured infants' body dimensions. Additional pilot data include various age groups, drop-off heights, and procedures. Videos from a subset of infants were excluded for various reasons.

(65 years or older) decided whether they could squeeze sideways through narrow doorways and inch sideways along narrow ledges while walking over a raised platform. Doorways and ledges varied in width from 0 to 64 cm. Doorway and ledge widths were presented with a psychophysical staircase procedure and each participant received ~ 33 trials per condition. Participants' behaviors were recorded from overhead frontal and side views; doorway and ledge widths were also recorded. At the end of each session, participants' body size was measured in the doorway.

months. At 11 months, all infants were experienced crawlers; at 13 months, half began to walk independently. At each session, mothers reported demographic information, infants' locomotor history, and receptive and productive language using the long form of the MCDI. To confirm infants' locomotor status (crawler or walker) and examine locomotor proficiency, infants were observed crawling and walking on a marked 3-foot runner. Three published papers report infants' object interactions, object carrying, and maternal responses to infants' object sharing.
