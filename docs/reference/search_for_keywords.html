The circumstances in which human observers produce different types of eye, head, and body motions differ across the life span, in part due to changes in locomotor abilities and declines in the frequency of passive locomotion. Scene geometry and body posture and position also contribute to the statistics of optic flow. Previous research has shown that 9.5 month-old infants undergoing passive locomotion -- carried by their parents in a forward facing carrier -- view different patterns and speeds of retinal- and head-centered optic flow (Raudies et al., 2012). Here we assess the patterns and speeds of head-centered optic flow experienced by infants across a wider range of ages, postures, and geometries. The data come from videos recorded from infant and adult observers who wore head-mounted cameras while they performed simple natural activities -- walking, sitting, playing with toys, and interacting with caregivers. We estimated optic flow from short (~30 sec) long segments using the method of Brox et al. (2004). From the flow estimates, we characterized the relative frequency of global rotation (yaw, pitch, and roll) and translation (forward/backward, up/down, and side to side) patterns and overall speeds. We found that infants who are not moving passively view translational flow patterns significantly more often than infant/mother dyads in paired locomotion. Further, infants who are not coupled to an adult in locomotion view a broader, wider, and slower distribution of flow speeds. Thus, the statistics of optic flow differ depending on the type (active vs. passive) self-motion. This implies that the relative frequency of experienced flow patterns and speeds may change substantially across development. Computer vision-based techniques permit a detailed analysis of the statistics of the natural visual environment during development.

Their reaching and avoidance responses were compared in two postures, an experienced sitting posture and a less familiar crawling posture. The babies avoided reaching over risky gaps in the sitting posture but fell into risky gaps while attempting to reach in the crawling posture. This dissociation between developmental changes in posture suggests that (a) each postural milestone represents a different, modularly organized control system and (b) infants' adaptive avoidance responses are based on information about their postural stability relative to the gap size. Moreover, the results belie previous accounts suggesting that avoidance of a disparity in depth of the ground surface depends on general knowledge such as fear of heights, associations between depth information and falling, or knowledge that the body cannot be supported in empty space.

At the same time, infants' bodies and skills continually change. The changing demands of everyday locomotion require infants to adapt locomotion to the properties of the terrain and to their own physical abilities. This Monograph examines how infants acquire adaptive locomotion in a novel task--going up and down slopes. Infants were tested longitudinally from their first week of crawling until several weeks after they began walking. Everyday locomotor experience played a central role in adaptive responding. Over weeks of crawling, infants' judgments became increasingly accurate, and exploration became increasingly efficient. There was no transfer over the transition from crawling to walking. Instead, infants learned, all over again, how to cope with slopes from an upright position. Findings indicate that learning generalized from everyday experience traveling over flat surfaces at home but that learning was specific to infants' typical method of locomotion and vantage point. Moreover, learning was not the result of simple associations between a particular locomotor response and a particular slope. Rather, infants learned to gauge their abilities on-line as they encountered each hill at the start of the trial. Change in locomotor responses and exploratory movements revealed a process of differentiation and selection spurred by changes in infants' everyday experience, body dimensions, and locomotor proficiency on flat ground.

Despite its importance for spatial perception and for guiding locomotion, very little is known about how the ability to perceive one’s direction of motion, or heading, from optic flow develops early in life. In this article, we report the results of 3 experiments that tested the abilities of 4-month-old infants to discriminate optic flow patterns simulating different directions of self-motion. The combined results from 2 different experimental paradigms suggest that 4-month-olds discriminate optic flow patterns that simulate only large (&gt;32 deg) changes in the direction of the observer’s motion through space. This suggests that prior to the onset of locomotion, there are limitations on infants’ abilities to process patterns of optic flow related to self-motion.

As a result, the statistics of visual motion infant observers experience differ from adults in some situations. We ask whether these differences apply more generally, and if so, what factors account for them. In one analysis, we simulate the effects of changes in body posture, speed of locomotion, and surface geometry on motion statistics. In a second analysis, we empirically measure the statistics of visual motion experienced by observers across the first year of life using infant-perspective videos captured during episodes when infants were moving through space or were stationary. We include samples of infants in from North America and those from India, to assess how variations in cultural practices influence infants' visual experiences. We find that fast laminar motion patterns dominate the visual input young infants experience and that cultural differences play a small role in shaping visual motion experiences.

How do people select a particular action among equally possible alternatives? In six experiments, we determined whether action selection is consistent and biased toward one decision by observing participants’ decisions to go over or under a horizontal bar set at varying heights. We assessed the height at which participants transitioned from going over to under the bar within a “gray zone”—the range of bar heights at which going over and under were both possible. In Experiment 1, participants’ transition points were consistently located near the upper boundary of the gray zone, indicating a bias to go over rather than under the bar. Moreover, transitional behaviors were clustered tightly into a small region, indicating that decisions were highly consistent. Subsequent experiments examined potential influences on action selection. In Experiment 2, participants wore ankle weights to increase the cost of going over the bar. In Experiment 3, they were tested on a padded surface that made crawling under the bar more comfortable. In Experiment 4, we introduced a secondary task that required participants to crawl immediately after navigating the bar. None of these manipulations altered participants’ decisions relative to Experiment 1. In Experiment 5, participants started in a crawling position, which led to significantly lower transition points. In Experiment 6, we tested 5- to 6-year-old children as in Experiment 1 to determine the effects of social pressure on action selection. Children displayed lower transition points, larger transition regions, and reduced ability to go over the bar compared to adults. Across experiments, results indicate that adults have a strong and robust bias for upright locomotion.

Illustrates use of toys to lure baby. Experimenters are particularly talented.\n\nCrawling Example 2: Experimenter carrying baby, mom at end of walkway, gridded high-density foam surface. Example of how to run crawling gait when only one experimenter is available.\n\nCrawling Example 3: Experimenter carrying baby, mom and experimenter at end of walkway, gridded high-density foam surface, infant wearing head-mounted eye tracker.\n\nLocomotor histories correspond to pdf's by Subject #. Note how experimenter clearly defines the criteria over and over. She zeroes in on the correct age through a "negotiation" with the parent. If parent gives an age, experimenter returns with a date. If parent offers a date, experimenter returns with an age. Then experimenter tries to get parent to remember specific event when baby was walking/cruising/crawling (a holiday, birthday, special outing).\n\nBlank form for entering parent's report about the baby's locomotion. Date fields on the right provide a "cheat sheet" so that the experimenter can quickly translate dates into ages and ages into dates.\n\nExcerpt of testing sitting proficiency: experimenter tests number of seconds the baby is able to maintain upright posture with hands up in the air while doing a long sit and a short sit. Experimenter also tests sitting balance using the Segmental Assessment of Trunk Control (SATCo).

Here we develop a set of techniques to study the optic flow experienced by infants and mothers during locomotion as a first step toward a broader analysis of the statistics of the natural visual environment during development.

To test whether classic findings from screen-based studies generalize to real-world visual exploration and to compare natural visual exploration in infants and adults, we tested observers in a new paradigm that combines critical aspects of both previous techniques: free viewing during real-world visual exploration. Mothers and their 9-month-old infants wore head-mounted eye trackers while mothers carried their infants in a forward-facing infant carrier through a series of indoor hallways. Demands for visual guidance of action were minimal in mothers and absent for infants, so both engaged in free viewing while moving through the environment. Similar to screen-based studies, during free viewing in the real world low-level saliency was related to gaze direction. In contrast to screen-based studies, only infants - not adults - were biased to look at people, participants of both ages did not show a classic center bias, and mothers and infants did not display high levels of inter-observer consistency. Results indicate that several aspects of visual exploration of a flat screen display do not generalize to visual exploration in the real world.

However, common paradigms for studying infant-caregiver interaction oversimplify the act of social looking by placing infants and caregivers in stationary positions facing each other. In more naturalistic settings, infants and caregivers must coordinate movements of their bodies and heads to look at each another amid the demands of other ongoing actions. We hypothesized that social looking for each member of the dyad would be affected by 1) the motor costs of looking and 2) competition between the social partner’s face and other visual targets. To test these hypotheses, twelve-month-old infants and their parents wore head-mounted eye trackers to provide a moment-by-moment measure of whether each member of the dyad looked at the other’s face or looked at toys. Findings revealed that motor costs did affect looking: Social looking varied according to the body posture of infants and caregivers. Transitions between postures changed the likelihood of face looking by altering the observer’s viewpoint and the availability of the social partner’s face. Moreover, the presence of other visual targets greatly impacted infants’ but not caregivers’ social looking: Infants rarely looked at their parents’ faces but often looked at toys. In contrast, parents frequently looked at both infants’ faces and toys.

Recent research suggests that locomotor exploration is not primarily directed toward reaching distant people, places or things. We asked whether a room with toys designed to encourage movement (stroller, ball, etc.) elicits more locomotor exploration than a room with no toys. Surprisingly, 15-month-old infants produced the same quantity of locomotion in both rooms—even though most walking bouts involved toys when available. Our findings suggest that mere space to move is sufficient to elicit locomotion. However, the quality of locomotor exploration differed. Infants in the toy condition explored a larger percent of the room, and spent a smaller percent of the session within 100 cm of their caregiver. Thus, while not required to elicit locomotion, the presence of alluring destinations seem to encourage infants to travel to new and unexplored areas.

We examined cruisers' understanding of support for upright locomotion under four conditions: cruising over a wooden handrail at chest height, a large gap in the handrail, a wobbly unstable handrail, and an ill positioned low handrail. Infants distinguished among the support properties of the handrails with differential attempts to cruise and handrail-specific forms of haptic exploration and gait modifications. They consistently attempted the wood handrail, rarely attempted the gap, and occasionally attempted the low and wobbly handrails. On the wood and gap handrails, attempt rates matched the probability of cruising successfully; but on the low and wobbly handrails, attempt rates under- and over-estimated the probability of success, respectively. Haptic exploration was most frequent and varied on the wobbly handrail, and gait modifications-including previously undocumented "knee cruising"-were most frequent and effective on the low handrail.

Gaze patterns in response to the focus of radial optic flow were measured in human infants (N = 100, 4–18 months) and in adults (N = 20) using an eye-tracking technique. Overall, although the adults showed an advantage in detecting the focus of an expansion flow (representing forward locomotion) against that of a contraction flow (representing backward locomotion), infants younger than 1 year showed an advantage in detecting the focus of a contraction flow. Infants aged between 13 and 18 months showed no significant advantage in detecting the focus in either the expansion or in the contraction flow. The uniqueness of the gaze patterns in response to the focus of radial optic flow in infants shows that the visual information necessary to perceive heading direction potentially differs between younger and mature individuals.

Natural free play represents the foundation of infant learning, but we know little about how infants play, how play unfolds in real time and across development, and how individual and group differences promote infant learning and development through play. To answer these questions, the PLAY project will collect, code, and share 900 hours of video collected in the homes of children at 12, 18, and 24 months of age drawn from 30 sites across North America.\n\nThe aim of the project is to develop a new approach to developmental science that enables (1) “big” data science for researchers who would not otherwise have access; (2) a communal, low-cost means of collecting and coding data that retains the autonomy of individual labs; and (3) a plan for leveraging diverse expertise to address a common goal.\n\nThis volume consists of materials discussed at a workshop held at NICHD on December 16, 2016 supported by NICHD, LEGO Foundation, and New York University.

Fifty infants were observed longitudinally during home observations. At 11 months, all infants were crawlers; at 13 months, half became walkers. Over age, infants increased their total time with objects and frequency of sharing objects with mothers. Bidirectional influences between locomotion and object actions were found. Walking was associated with new forms of object behaviors: Walkers accessed distant objects, carried objects, and approached mothers to share objects; crawlers preferred objects close at hand and shared objects while remaining stationary. Earlier object activities predicted walking status: Crawlers who accessed distant objects, carried objects, and shared objects over distances at 11 months were more likely to walk by 13 months.

A longstanding assumption is that infants primarily crawl or walk to reach destinations viewed while stationary. However, many bouts of spontaneous locomotion do not end at new people, places, or things. Study 1 showed that half of 10- and 13- month-old crawlers’ (N = 29) bouts end at destinations—more than previously found with walkers. Study 2 confirmed that, although infants do not commonly go to destinations, 12-month-old crawlers go to proportionally more destinations than age-matched walkers (N = 16). Head-mounted eye tracking revealed that, crawlers and walkers mostly take steps in place while fixating something within reach. When infants do go to a destination, they take straight, short paths to a target fixated while stationary.\n\nFor videos of full sessions, see volume links.

Here, we illustrate the Overlapping Waves Model with video clips from several studies in infant and child motor development. (See links for specific papers relevant to the excerpts).\n\nIllustration #1: Infants' use of various strategies for descending impossibly steep slopes (backing feet first, sliding head first, sitting, crawling, walking, avoiding descent). Longitudinal observations show that strategies entered infants' repertoires at various ages and changed in frequency as infants became more accurate at detecting affordances for descent over weeks of crawling and walking. See links for Illustration #1-Longitudinal.\nCross-sectional observations show that individual infants use multiple strategies within a single session. See links for Illustration #1-Cross-sectional.\n\nIllustration #2: Walking infants use multiple strategies for descending drop-offs (backing feet first, sitting, crawling, walking, avoiding descent).

This experiment investigated the real-time process of visual and haptic exploration in 14-month-old infants as they decided whether and how to walk over challenging terrain—a series of bridges varying in width. Infants’ direction of gaze was recorded with a head-mounted eye tracker and their haptic exploration and locomotor actions were captured on video. Infants’ exploration was an organized, efficient sequence of visual, haptic, and locomotor behaviors. They used visual exploration from a distance as an initial assessment on nearly every bridge. Visual information subsequently prompted gait modifications while approaching narrow bridges and haptic exploration at the edge of the bridge. Results confirm predictions about the sequential, ramping-up process of exploration and the distinct roles of vision and touch. Exploration, however, was not a guarantee of adaptive decisions. With walking experience, exploratory behaviors became increasingly efficient and infants were better able to interpret the resulting perceptual information in terms of whether it was safe to walk.

The head-mounted cameras recorded infants' eye position and field of view. A wheeled camera alongside the platform recorded infants' locomotion from a side view. Caregivers stood at the far end of the walkway and held toys at low, medium, and high elevations to provide targets for infants' gaze. An additional group of 13-month-olds crawled or walked over a gridded platform wearing an electromagnetic motion tracker (Ascension TrakSTAR) to record position and orientation of their heads. In every study, parents provided retrospective reports of infants' locomotor experience and an experimenter measured infants' body dimensions. Additional pilot data include changes in procedure. Videos from a subset of infants were excluded for various reasons.

An additional group of 14-month-olds walked over a "visual bridge" apparatus, designed to match an apparatus with a real bridge and drop-off. Here, the drop-off and bridge were only illusory. Bridge widths were presented with a psychophysical staircase procedure and each infant received ~40 trials. In each study, an experimenter rescued infants if they fell. In every study, infants' behavior was recorded from side, front, and overhead views, parents provided retrospective reports of infants' crawling, walking, and falling experience, and an experimenter measured infants' body dimensions. Additional pilot data include various age groups, drop-off heights, and procedures. Videos from a subset of infants were excluded for various reasons.

Doorways and ledges varied in width from 0 to 64 cm. Doorway and ledge widths were presented with a psychophysical staircase procedure and each participant received ~ 33 trials per condition. Participants' behaviors were recorded from overhead frontal and side views; doorway and ledge widths were also recorded. At the end of each session, participants' body size was measured in the doorway.
#&gt; 23 This dataset includes videos of real-life falls experienced by older adult residents of long-term care homes.\n\nDATA DESCRIPTION:\n\nThe dataset contains 105 videos of falls experienced by 61 adults (31 women who accounted for 56 falls, and 30 men who accounted for 49 falls). At the time of falling, the individuals ranged in age from 59 years to 98 years (mean age = 83.7 years, SD = 8.1 years). All individuals captured falling were residing in two partnering long-term care facilities in British Columbia, where the falls occurred. All falls occurred in common areas of the long-term care homes (lounges, dining rooms and hallways). No cameras were installed in bedrooms or bathrooms. \n\nEach individual captured falling or their decision maker has provided informed consent for sharing the data (videos and related information from fall incident reports) for research and education. Faces on the videos have been blurred. Furthermore, the videos have been edited and selected so that the only person shown in the video is the individual captured falling. Accordingly, videos of falls in crowded areas have generally not been included, and videos have been trimmed to end before care staff appears in the camera view.\n\nIn cases where a given fall was captured by more than one camera, the views from the individual cameras have been combined into a single video file. Most falls (n=67) were captured with only one camera view. For 33 falls, videos are included from two camera views, and for 5 falls, videos are included from three camera views. \n\nThe falls were recorded on video at a frame rate between 3 and 30 frames per second (fps). 78% of falls (n=82) were recorded at 30 fps. Nine falls were recorded at a frame rate below 15 Hz. \n\nThe camera resolution ranged from 352 x 240 pixels to 1920 x 1080 pixels. 87% of videos (n=91) were recorded with a resolution equal or greater than 640 x 480. \n\nAll videos have been converted to 640 x 480 pixels, and a frame rate of 24 fps or 30 fps. In cases where the original frame rate was less than 30 fps (or 24 fps), this will have resulted in duplication of successive images in the video.\n\nAll videos are in mp4 format. \n\nSTRUCTURE OF THE DATASET:\n\nEach folder contains a video (.mp4) file, depicting a single fall event. For falls captured by more than one camera, the views from the individual cameras have been combined into a single video file. Each video is named as [analyzed video number]_[date of fall (mmddyyyy)].\n\nEach folder also contains an Excel file (.xlsx) with information from the fall incident report and minimum data set (MDS) assessment taken within 6 months before the fall, along with the number of camera views, original frame rate and resolution of the video. These files are named as [analyzed video number]. Each spreadsheet contains a second (“key”) tab that explains the nature of data on the first tab.\n\nA master spreadsheet contains fall incident report and MDS data for all 105 falls ("Master spreadsheet - Falls experienced by older adult residents in long-term care homes.xlsx").\n\nDATA ROWS (for master spreadsheet):\n- Video Number\n- Identifier (of the individual captured falling)\n- Views (number of camera views of the fall)\n- Original Video Resolution (pixels)\n- Original Video Frame Rate (frames per second (fps))\n- Edited Video Resolution and Frame Rate\n- Age (years)\n- Gender\n- Height (cm)\n- Weight (kg)\n- Date of Fall\n- Falls within Last 6 Months\n- Fractures within Last 6 Months\n- Use of Mobility Aid (habitual; may not match video)\n- ADL Self-Performance Hierarchy Scale (0-6, with 6 being the most impaired)\n- Cognitive Performance Scale (0-6, with 6 being the most impaired)\n- Vision Patterns Score (0-4, with 4 being the most impaired)\n- Disease Diagnoses\n- # of Medications per Week\n- Type of Medications\n- Was a Serious Injury Reported\n- Did a Hip Fracture Occur\n- Reported Injuries\n\nNote: The spreadsheet contains a second (“key”) tab that explains the nature of data on the first tab.\n\nREFERENCES:\nIn publications that use this dataset, please reference the following publication:\nRobinovitch SN, Feldman F, Yang Y, Schonnop R, Leung PM, Sarraf T, Sims-Gould J, and Loughin M: Video capture of the circumstances of falls in elderly people residing in long-term care: an observational study.

While held in their mother’s arms or seated across from one another, pre-mobile infants and their caregivers spontaneously engage in a sequence of contingent facial expressions and vocalizations that researchers have referred to as a social “dance.” Does this dance continue when both partners are free to move across the floor? The current study assessed locomotor synchrony in 13- 19-month-old infant-mother dyads (N = 30) by tracking each partner’s step-to-step location during free play. Infants and mothers spontaneously synchronized their locomotor behavior, but dyads accomplished synchrony differently. Moreover, infants were more likely to move first and to control the dyad’s path when both partners were in motion.
